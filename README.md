# 3D-reconstruction
Does camera calibration, rectification, correspondence and finally 3D reconstruction

The correspondence is done using a simple mix of SSD and normalized cross correlation. Since this method is not perfect, hence nor are the correspondences for the same, an approximate sparse map of the 3D face can be obtained.
